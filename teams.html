            Our team is constantly grinding in Fortnite™ to make our way up to the most powerful Fortnite™ player of all: Ninja.
            One day, we will surpass Ninja and claim the spot as top Fortnite™ gamers.
            And against Ninja, there's always something to learn, and always room for improvement.
            Never settle.

        <p>
            Now, only one of us on the team plays Genshin Impact.
            I've only ever seen the game once, and it was in a 15 minute Discord stream that was part of a "quest" or something.
            All he did was spend money and try to get a character.
            But our Genshin Impact player is one of the most dedicated gamers on the planet.
            He's not afraid to invest thousands of dollars if it means that he can top the leaderboards.

        <p>
            I'm gonna keep it real, I haven't played Clash of Clans since I was like 14 years old.
            But for our members that still play, they have some of the strongest bases you could ever come up with.
            No one has ever taken down one of these bases.
            And on top of that, they've never failed an attack either.
            Yeah, they're just that powerful.
            If you're trying to take us down, good luck.
            You'll need it, kid.

            Our players make some of the top players in the game look like garbage!
            They are NOTHING compared to us!
            When our team plays fighting games, we pick only the most honest characters you could possibly play.
            The ones that have to work the hardest.
            Honest characters like Sin or Ky.
            We might not be at the top right now, but that's because we're out here slaving away, grinding it out and climbing slowly but surely.
            That way, when we make it to the top, we can show just how much better we are than these carried players.
            Let's STRIVE for greatness this upcoming EVO!
